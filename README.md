## Description

I implemented a machine learning algorithm to quantify the probability of customer conversion following advertisement exposure, based on customer data. I then derived a function to optimize marketing budgets using the model's results, and evaluated the resulting distributed marketing allocation on withheld test data. Ultimately, this approach resulted in a 124% improvement over a naive, uniform marketing strategy, demonstrating the efficacy of ML-based decision making.
